Hello readme file.

Please understand that I'm a bit old to be so new to this learning thing.  I beg your forgiveness if I do stupid things and don't follow you to the objective I should reach.  I will do my best.  I am, after all, being payed to test an app that I need to automate, however, you need to know code to automate.  I don't know code.  I am, therefor, screwed.
